# Company Employee Tracker

## Company Employee Tracker
To create this employee tracker, I first started by creating my database and setting the specific parameters for my employee name, title, manager, salary, department, and role in the schema.sql file. After creating the specific parameters, I then moved on to the seeds.sql file and created all of my pre-populated data using players, coaches, and front office names from the NFL. Once I finished pre-populating data for my database, I started on pulling all of that data together in the server.js file. I started with creating the views for all of the employee list. Then I moved on to adding, updating, deleting, and the view for the budget for the department. I had to do a little bit of troubleshooting at first to get the data to show up when I typed in node server.js to start the application in the terminal.
